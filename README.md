Bookmarklet for generating a Trello Checklist
---------------------------------------------

Tired of manually inputting checklists for your tasks on Trello? Try the bookmarklet!

Simply copy-paste the contents of bookmarklet.js into the URL field of a new bookmark in your web browser. Then, when you're viewing a task in Trello (which does not yet have a Checklist), simply click on your bookmark and your task list will be automatically generated.

The "default" content provides checklist items for a generic Definition of Done, but you can simply edit it to suit your needs.
